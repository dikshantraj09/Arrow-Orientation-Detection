# Arrow-Orientation-Detection
Detects whether the arrow is pointing Right, Left, Up or Down using OpenCV

# How to use?
utils.py is a self made module with all the important functions.
ArrowDetectionMod.py is directly detecting the arrow and finding the Direction.
But in the other file 1st it detects a Box and creates it the Region of Interest and in that box detects the orientation of the arrow.
